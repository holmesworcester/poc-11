//! Pass 2 (validation / projection): drive the §3 "queue that gets played" as
//! an explicit worklist over in-memory admitted facts. Replay starts from a
//! bounded seed/window, pulls stored offerers for unmet needs, promotes only
//! validated offers, and wakes matching needers until the queues reach a fixpoint.
//!
//! Durable storage is read-only here. Facts loaded from storage are decoded and
//! indexed in memory, but their already-persisted bytes/edges are not re-written.
//!
//! Invariant checklist (Verus):
//! Invariant owner: replay/wake API semantics.
//! - [ ] Replay seeds schedule admission work only; validity comes from the
//!       engine drain they trigger.
//! - [ ] Replay may discover the dependency closure through need-to-offer lookup,
//!       but it does not rewrite already-persisted facts or asserted edges.
//! - [ ] Wake schedules work from newly available facts through matching needers.
//! - [ ] Successful replay/wake results report the engine validity map after the
//!       work queue drains; bounded drain exhaustion is an error.
//! - [ ] Soundness of each drain prefix belongs to `core::engine` and
//!       `core::turn`.
